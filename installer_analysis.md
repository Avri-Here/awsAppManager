# AWS App Manager Installer Analysis

## Current Behavior vs Expected Behavior

### Issue 1: Custom Welcome Page Not Working
**Current:** Default NSIS welcome page is shown
**Expected:** Custom welcome page from installer.nsh should be displayed
**Problem:** Custom pages are not being properly integrated with NSIS installer flow

### Issue 2: Installation Options Page Missing
**Current:** User sees default NSIS installation pages
**Expected:** Custom options page should allow users to choose shortcuts/auto-start
**Problem:** Custom pages are not replacing default NSIS pages

### Issue 3: Unwanted "Installing..." Page
**Current:** Shows "Installing AWS App Manager..." page that requires Next click
**Expected:** Installation should proceed automatically without manual intervention
**Problem:** Custom progress page is blocking installation flow

### Issue 4: Unwanted "Choose Installation Options" Dialog
**Current:** Shows per-machine vs per-user installation choice
**Expected:** Should install for current user only without asking
**Problem:** `perMachine: false` setting not working as expected

### Issue 5: Unwanted "Choose Install Location" Dialog
**Current:** Allows user to browse and select installation directory
**Expected:** Should install to default location without user choice
**Problem:** `allowToChangeInstallationDirectory: true` should be `false`

### Issue 6: Shortcuts Created Despite Being Disabled
**Current:** Desktop and Start Menu shortcuts are created even when disabled
**Expected:** No shortcuts should be created when options are disabled
**Problem:** Default NSIS behavior overrides custom settings

### Issue 7: Application Doesn't Launch After Installation
**Current:** App doesn't start even when "Run awsAppManager" is checked
**Expected:** Application should launch when finish option is enabled
**Problem:** Possible path or executable issues

## Root Cause Analysis

1. **Custom Pages Not Integrated:** The custom pages in installer.nsh are not properly replacing the default NSIS pages
2. **Configuration Conflicts:** Default NSIS settings are overriding custom configurations
3. **Page Flow Issues:** Custom pages are being added instead of replacing default ones
4. **Shortcut Logic Problems:** Custom shortcut creation logic conflicts with default NSIS behavior

5. **Fix Application Launch:** Resolve executable path and launch issues

2. **Phase 2:** Properly integrate custom pages and disable default ones
3. **Phase 3:** Fix shortcut creation logic
4. **Phase 4:** Fix application launch functionality
5. **Phase 5:** Test complete installer flow
